		<h2>Cow colostrum</h2>
				
		<h3>What Is Colostrum?</h3>
		<p>Colostrum is a milky fluid that’s released by mammals that have recently given birth before breast milk production begins.</p>
		<p>It’s an important source of nutrients that promotes growth and fights disease in infants, but it can also be consumed during other phases of life — typically in supplement form.</p>
		<p>Even though all mammals produce colostrum, supplements are usually made from the colostrum of cows. This supplement is known as bovine colostrum.</p>
		<p>Bovine colostrum is similar to human colostrum — rich in vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrates, disease-fighting proteins, growth hormones, and digestive enzymes.</p>
		<p>Bovine colostrum supplements have become popular in recent years, as they may promote immunity, fight infection, and improve gut health.</p>
		<p>For these supplements colostrum from cows is pasteurized and dried into pills or into powders that can be mixed with liquids. Bovine colostrum typically has a light yellow colour and a subtle taste and smell that resembles buttermilk.</p>

		<h3>Highly Nutritious</h3>
		<p>Bovine colostrum is extremely nutritious and contains more nutrients than regular milk.</p>
		<p>In particular, it’s higher in protein, fat, carbs, magnesium, B vitamins, and vitamins A, C, and E than cow’s milk.</p>
		<p>While colostrum is rich in macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals, its claimed health benefits are mostly linked to specific protein compounds, which include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Lactoferrin</b><br>
				<p>Lactoferrin is a protein involved in your body’s immune response to infections, including those caused by bacteria and viruses.</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Growth factors</b><br>
				<p>Growth factors are hormones that stimulate growth. Bovine colostrum is especially high in two protein-based hormones, insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2, or IGF-1 and IGF-2</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Antibodies</b><br>
				<p>Antibodies are proteins, also known as immunoglobulins, used by your immune system to fight bacteria and viruses. Bovine colostrum is rich in the antibodies IgA, IgG, and IgM.</p>
				<p>Since bovine colostrum is loaded with nutrients that fight disease and promote growth, it may be able to boost immunity, treat infections, and offer more related benefits in humans throughout life.</p>
